ABOUT THE DATA SET:
About one in seven U.S. adults has diabetes now, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
But by 2050, that rate could skyrocket to as many as one in three. With this in mind, learning how to use Machine Learning to help us predict Diabetes


SVM (SUPORT VECTOR MACHINE):
Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are a powerful tool to identify predictive models or classifiers, not only because they accommodate well sparse data but also because they can classify groups or create predictive rules for data that cannot be classified by linear decision functions.
